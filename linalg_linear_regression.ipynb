    "\n",
    "The equation system $Ax = b$ might not have a solution, but there exists a _p_ so that $Ax=p$ is solvable. And (this is the key) I want _p_ to be the closest vector to the original vector _b_ !.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the projection matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "I will project a vector b to a subpace spanned by the columns of a matrix A. That is, its projection _p_, will be in the column space of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is that, because we want the closest projected vector _p_ to _b_, _p_ has to be perpendicular to the column space of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: Multiplying _A_ with _b_ ($Ab=\\hat{p}$) will successfully project _b_ onto the column space of _A_ (by definition), but that resulting vector $\\hat{p}$ will not necessarily suffice our condition that it must be perpendicular to the plane!! And thus, it would be incorrect to think that $Ab=p$.\n",

    "Graphically (notice the place, the vector _b_, the vector _p_, and the error vector _e_):\n",
    "<img src='img/linalg_projection_matrix.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, the projection will be some multiple of the columns of the matrix _A_: $Ax=p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, then, the error vector will be $e = b - p = b - Ax$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, by _our_ definition, the error vector will be perpendicular to the plane (that is, perpendicular to the columns of _A_), and so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^T e = 0 \\Rightarrow A^T (b-p) = 0 \\Rightarrow A^T (b - Ax) \\Rightarrow A^T b = A^T A x\n",

    "From which we can conclude that:\n",
    "1. The vector _x_ (multiple of the columns of A) is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = (A^T A) ^{-1} A^T b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2. The projection $Ax$ is then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = Ax = A (A^T A) ^{-1} A^T b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "3. And from the previous point, the projection matrix is (what is multiplying the original vector _b_):\n",
